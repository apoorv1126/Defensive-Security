About : 
Adversary emulation aims to test a network’s resilience against advanced attackers or advanced persistent threats (APTs). 
To do so, the adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are emulated along the cyber kill chain, leading deeper into the target network on to the objectives or flags.
